<b>Notes:</b> 
<ul>
<li> Lovely, lovely, lovely...
<li> Lame problem controlled by applied tensions. Near threshold
  analysis (linear stab analysis) agrees with ComanBassom2007
  (and "our" approach; see discussion/notes for ComanBassom2007 paper).
<li> FFT analysis: extent of wrinkling region from tension field
  theory (neglecting all bending effects; setting epsilon = 0).
  Wrinkling wavenumber follows from next term in that expansion
  (though not done (or at least not presented) formally in this way).
<li> Stress field and number of wrinkles change significantly as one
  goes from NT to FFT regime; wrinkle extent more robust than wavenumber.
<li> Comments on apparent discrepancy with GeminardEtAl2004
  experiments (range of epsilon considered there is too small to
  disprove the scalings found here).
<li> Single parameter case (T_outer=0) is excluded from analysis
because everything's scaled on T_outer (as in ComanBassom2007) where
everything's scaled on U_outer=U_2).

<b>Notes:</b> 
<ul>
<li> Lovely follow-up from DavidovitchEtAl2011 and again full of genius.
<li> Assuming that NT and FFT (and everything in between!) wrinkles 
can be described by a single azimuthal Fourier mode they
  show how the likely-to-observed wrinkle wavenumber (assumed to 
  follow from overall energy minimisation; they are still checking all 
  possible modes!) evolves as one increases the forcing (at the inner
  boundary) beyond threshold from NT to FFT regime. Ties in nicely
  with the limits obtained in DavidovitchEtAl2011 and rectifies some
  problems in the earlier analysis.
<li> Discusses limitations and possible ways to extend theory to
  multiple modes etc. very honestly.

<b>Notes:</b> 
<ul>
<li> Very nice, mainly experimental paper that uses essentially
the setup that Draga proposed (and already has in the lab). Main 
difference is that the deflection inside the inner support is created
by suction rather than a pokey stick).
<li> Note lovely introduction with lots of good applications too!
<li> Experiments show that number of wrinkles is independent of
  displacement at inner radius
  but increases linearly with radius of inner cylinder. Increase in
  initial tension (via stretching of the membrane -- achieved by a 
  nice mechanism!)
  leads to a slight increase in wrinkling wavenumber.
<li> Note: linear dependence on wrinkling wavenumber on inner radius
contradicts DavidovitchEtAl2011 but they comment on this and stress
  that range of epsilon (their notation) is too small to be conclusive.
<li> Wrinkling is supercritical (square root behaviour of amplitude).
<li> All done for one fixed membrane thickness, h=0.2mm. 
<li> Comment on beta=0 (zero pre-stretch, i.e. no outer displacement)
being both odd (in terms of theory) and difficult (experimentally).

<ul>
<li> Linear stability analysis for "Lame problem" (circular sheet with
  hole, loaded by displacements (!) on inner/outer radius).
<li> Setup: Given bending stiffness, radii and material properties, 
apply outward displacement U_outer at outer edge. Then increase inner displ.
(characterised via lambda=U_inner/U_outer) until wrinkling occurs.
<li> Prediction for most unstable azimuthal wavenumber: n =
  O(mu^{3/4})
<li> Given that mu^2 = 12 U_outer R_outer / h^2, this is consistent
  with DavidovitchEtAl2011 prediction, eqn (10) in the latter paper 
  (as claimed there).
<li> Note that Coman's analysis assumes U_outer &lt; 0  so excludes the single
  parameter problem that we're after. Using our approach it's possible
to show that for U_outer \ne 0, the wavenumber depends on U_outer
  R_outer / h^2 (as in Coman and DavidovitchEtAl2011's analyses) though
we can't extract the power law.

<ul>
<li> Disclaimer before we start: Despite all the problems listed below a
really lovely paper...
<li> Somewhat ad-hoc (rather than rational (as claimed)) extension to
  FvK by using full geometrically nonlinear expressions for in-plane
  stress. This is supposed to cater for large strain but ignores the
  fact that Hooke's law is still built into the theory (and is
  unlikely to apply at such large strains).
<li> Discretisation with Hermite quads; stability analysis and large
amplitude computations.
<li> Key feature of extended model is that:
<ul>
<li> Wrinkling only happens for certain sheet aspect ratios
<li> Amplitude of wrinkles grows (once past threshold) but then decays
again; this is claimed to be "realistic" though no experimental
  references are provided. By contrast, FvK wrinkle amplitude grows 
  indefinitely, which admittedly seems unlikely...
<li> In the limit h tends to 0, the extra terms in the strain will
vanish, leaving behind exactly FVK. This is also evident in
the plots, as with smaller thickness the solutions match for
longer. 
<li> FvK is asymptotically accurate, given certain scaling assumptions
(which are the questionable bit), so its likely that whatever
FvK is doing wrong at large strains is due to these implicit scaling
assumptions breaking down.  
<li> According to several papers [Hure et al. 2012, Davidovitch et al. 2012]
 we should expect that the wrinkled region at very large strains completely 
"collapses" the compressive stress (the tensile stress remains virtually
 unchanged), by means of the formation of an increasingly fine wrinkling
 pattern with vanishing amplitude.
<li> This is expected in sheets where FFT holds [Davidovitch et al. 2012]
in which, in accordance with the relaxation model of tension field theory, 
the fine wrinkling pattern (that is not characterised by the TFT model but is
accounted for by the "subdominant energy") is assumed to be present in
the "collapsed" region [Pipkin 1986, Steigmann 1990, Taylor et al. 2014].
<li> This only works for sheets that have tensile stresses in one direction
that suppress the formation of "folds" and crumples. Stress focusing such 
as folding and crumpling occur in sheets that are "slack" in both directions 
(see [Demery et al. 2014] and [Holmes and Crosby 2010]).
<li> It's possible that the fact that the FvK model does
not predict this is a product of "the over separation of scales" that 
[Freisecke et. al., 2006] describe: this over separation issue to the fact 
that the scaling assumptions of membrane, Foppl von Karman and bending 
theory mean that these theories all have completely different (built in)
behaviour in the limit of vanishing h, which has to be assumed a priori. 

<li> FvK computations do not exploit the (apparently unrecognised)
fact that the thickness can be scaled out. Rescaling, e.g. Fig. 6a,b
(which shows that the onset of wrinkling and the subsequent 
finite amplitude deformation do depend on thickness) shows that 
data collapses as we predicted.
This implies that for a given aspect ratio and material property 
(Poisson's ratio) only one computation is required; data for specific
thicknesses can then be recovered from this. 
<a href="HealeyEtAl2013_scaled_fig6a_and_6b.png">Plot is here.</a>
<li> Symmetric and antisymmetric wrinkling occurs (to within numerical
accuracy) at exactly the same pre-stretch (which is very
counter-intuitive because this mode coalescence is
non-generic). Implies that any super-position of the symmetric and 
antisymmetric modes is also a solution; this implies the existence
of a whole "orbit" of solutions.
</ul>
<li> <b>Good news:</b> The paper certainly motivates looking into 
thickness effects. The ad-hoc modification to the in-plane strain
means it no longer scales like (h/L)^2 but also has an (h/L)^4 term in
it. This introduces a genuine thickness dependence in the results.
Other (better?) modifications are likely to do so too. Paper provides
brief acknowledgement of Steigmann's theory.

<b>Notes:</b> 
<ul>
<li> This article presents a theory for sheets that incorporates finite strain
into the Koiter model.
<li> It specialises to the case of reflection symmetry of the plate properties 
with respect to the midplane. It also assumes isotropic plates properties.
<li> The model has to satisfy certain constitutive requirements, which are 
outlined in [Steigmann, 2003] which encompasses the materials studied by 
[Carroll, 1988].
<li> Comment (D): I think this will include the normal Kirchhoff St Venant model
, but I have not managed to decipher [Steigmann, 2003] yet..
<li> It is well--posed as a minimisation problem, but no  existence and 
uniqueness theorems have been proven. 
<li> This is the model [Taylor, Bertoldi 2014]  use and also 
[Taylor, Davidovitch 2015], it is also the theory that I propose
  we write into oomph-lib.

<b>Notes:</b> 
<ul>
<li> This presents the nonlinear Koiter theory of shells and places it in 
relation to 3D nonlinear elasticity. It additionally presents an extension to 
finite midsurface strains, which restricts the model to Kirchhoff St Venant 
consituitive laws.
<li> This article presents an alternative derivation of Koiters shell theory that
  allows an insight into its usefulness and scope in relation to 3D elasticity.
<li> As with all these models it is assumed that h &lt; &lt; L 
<li> Further specialisation to shells with midplane symmetry of material 
properties is made.
<li> This shows exactly how the original Koiter model and the Steigmann-Koiter 
model differ: on the stress assumption.
<li> For the Koiter model then, weakly non--linear extension to the Kirchhoff-St 
Venant model are appropriate.
<li> The final assumption Stiegmann makes for his model is that the midsurface 
stress, S= o(1), and thus vanishes with vanishing thickness, as opposed to the 
Koiter model which assumes that the stress  scales as S= a h + b h^2, with a and
 b independent of h.
<li> If the weaker assumption is used, the constitutive function has to be 
Kirchhoff-St Venant which gives separable bending and stretching energies.
<li> This article proposes the model of [Steigmann, 2013a] as an alternative to 
the Koiter model and an extension to finite midsurface strains.

<b>Notes:</b> 
<ul>
<li> Lovely explanation of how the Poisson effect induces wrinkling in this 
system.
<li> Really well explained Physics and an intuitive way of thinking about 
wrinkling.
<li> Builds on the results of tension field theory to create a compromise 
`far--from--threshold' theory.
<li> The assumptions drastically simplify the problem, but capture the essence 
of the behaviour (certainly in hindsight with more complex studies such as 
[Puntel, et al. 2010],  and numerics of reduced or full problems 
[Kim, et al. 2010][Nayvar et al. 2011]) which is a credit to the sheer intuition
 of the authors.
<li> They suggest the use of geometrically non--linear elasticity, but even so 
the Foppl von Karman--like functional they use is probably inappropriate for the 
picture shown at 10% stretch.
<li> To model the real problem they clamp two ends of the sheet which is in a 
state of plane stress, then impose uniform lateral contraction (related to the
transverse stretch by the Poisson effect) by Lagrange multiplier, to approximate
 the Poisson effect. 
<li> We can non-dimensionalize it all and just get lambda ~ T^(-1/4) where 
T is the non-dimensional tension (i.e. the single control parameter).
<li> Scanned notes show that prediction for wavenumber (under equation (5))
  is consistent with our FvK non-dimensionalization. 
<li> Amplitude grows indefinitely with imposed stretch (again under
  eqn (5)). As Healey observes this seems unlikely and may well
indicate another shortcoming of FvK. Mahadevan's prediction
for the dependence of the amplitude on the imposed stretch is 
consistent with HealeyEtAl2013, based on the scaled scans of his Fig. 
6ab -- at least in the large-amplitude regime:

<b>Notes:</b> 
<ul>
<li> Shell and plate theory for linear elasticity.
<li> Generalises linear Koiter theory to include order h^3 terms
<li> Also purports to includes a constrained model with "non--standard 2D 
strain-gradient effects" that affect the equations in a thin layer near an edge. 
These are motivated by comparison to 3D elasticity.
<li> Incorporates the models of bending and stretching under single framework 
with an explicit h parameter.
<li> The in and out of plane equations decouple for plates, giving the biharmonic
 equation, and a separate equation for in--plane behaviour which contains h 
dependence.
<li> The boundary conditions on the bending equation seem to be of standard form,
i.e mnn=Mnn and vn=-dl/dn-dmnl/dl=Vn (where l is Laplacian and mnn, mnl are 
internal normal and twisting moments respectively. Mnn is an applied normal 
moment and Vn is an applied edge force per unit length)
<li> Comment (D): He remarks that "classical plate theory... corresponds to 
conditions (m_x,m_y)=0 for which he says his assumption is less restrictive. 
Is the condition on (m_x,m_y) not the "naive" b/c that Poisson proposed that was
later corrected by Kirchhoff (see Selvadurai, ~page 298).
